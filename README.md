# graphql-nodejs-concept
Understanding GraphQL sometimes hard and confusing. That's why I create this simple project (using minimal framework and using array to represent database). The goal is simple, to get idea about what is GraphQL and what GraphQL can do.

In this imaginary project let say we have data of `artists` and `songs`. Songs have relation to artists.

All logic is on `index.mjs` file, so it should be simple.

After we understand about GraphQL, I think will be easy later if we want to replace the data layer with real connection to database.

## Libraries and tools used (see on `package.json`)

- `graphql`, as JS reference implementation for GraphQL.
- `graphql-yoga`, as GraphQL server.
- `nodemon`, just a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

## Sample data

```
const dataArtists = [
  { id: 1, name: "Peter Cetera" },
  { id: 2, name: "Dewa 19" },
  { id: 3, name: "Tito Soemarsono" },
  { id: 4, name: "Natalie Imbruglia" },
  { id: 5, name: "David Foster" },
  { id: 6, name: "Kahitna" },
]

const dataSongs = [
  { id: 1, title: "One Clear Voice", artistId: 1 },
  { id: 2, title: "Kangen", artistId: 2 },
  { id: 3, title: "Diam-diam", artistId: 3 },
  { id: 4, title: "Torn", artistId: 4 },
  { id: 5, title: "The Best of Me", artistId: 5 },
  { id: 6, title: "Cantik", artistId: 6 },
  { id: 7, title: "Cerita Cinta", artistId: 6 },
]
```

## Query methods

- `songs`, to get all songs
- `song`, to get particular song by id
- `artists`, to get all artists
- `artist`, to get particular song by id


## Mutation methods

- `addSong`, to add new song to array
- `updateSong`, to update particular song by id
- `deleteSong`, to delete particular song by id
- `addArtist`, to add new artist to array
- `updateArtist`, to update particular artist by id
